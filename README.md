------------------Inheritance Challenge------------------

Start with a base class of a Vehicle, then create a Car class that inherits from thisbase class. Finally, create another class, a specific type of Car (Say Honda City) that inherits from the Car class. You should be able to hand steering, changing gears, and moving (speed in other words).You will want to decide where to put the appropriate state and behaviours (fields and methods).As mentioned above, changing gears, increasing/decreasing speed should be included.For specific type of vehicle you will want to add something specific for that type of car.


------------------Polymorphism Challenge-----------------

Create a base class called Car. It should have a few fields that would be appropriate for a generic car class. For example, engine, cylinders, wheels, etc.Constructor should initialize cylinders (number of) and name, and set wheels to 4and engine to true. Cylinders and names would be passed parameters.Create appropriate getters.Create some methods like startEngine, accelerate, and brake show a message for each in the base class.Now create 3 sub classes for your favourite vehicles.Override the appropriate methods to demonstrate polymorphism in use.
